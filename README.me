The Tradesman is a small project that I built as a Python learning exercise.

The goal is to make a simple and stable asset trading game. Not even going to try to add a goal yet; just make the numbers go up!

Simple features include:
- 3 types of assets to trade
- 3 "Locations" with varying asset prices
- Save/Load functionality

That's it. Will update this if/when more comes of it.
